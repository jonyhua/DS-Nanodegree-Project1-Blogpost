## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using Seattle Airbnb Open Data to address the following questions:

1. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike?
2. Can you describe the vibe of each Seattle neighborhood using listing descriptions?
3. What are the factors influencing review score?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@jonyhwa/what-can-we-learn-about-seattle-from-the-open-airbnb-data-deb504414058).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Kaggel and Airbnb for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
